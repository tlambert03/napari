class PerfTimers:
    """Timers for performance monitoring.

    For each added PerfEvent we do two things:
    1) Update our self.timers dictionary (always).
    2) Write to a trace file (optionally if recording one).

    You can add a PerfEvent completely by hand by creating a
    PerfEvent object and calling add_event(). However typically
    you add PerfEvents one of three more automatic ways:

    1) Enable timing of Qt Events using QApplicationWithTracing.
    2) Patch in perf_timers using the perfmon config file.
    3) Add perf_timer context objects by hand.

    Methods 1 and 2 result in zero overhead if perfmon is disabled,
    but 3 results in a tiny amount of overhead (1 usec per timer)
    therefore best practice is remove manual perf_timers before
    merging into master. Consider them like debug prints.

    Attributes
    ----------
    timers : dict
        Maps a timer name to a SimpleStat object.
    trace_file : PerfTraceFile, optional
        The tracing file we are writing to if any.

    Notes
    -----
    Chrome deduces nesting based on the start and end times of each timer. The
    chrome://tracing GUI shows the nesting as stacks of colored rectangles.

    However our self.timers dictionary and thus our QtPerformance widget do not
    currently understand nesting. So if they say two timers each took 1ms, you
    can't tell if one called the other or not.

    Despite this limitation when the QtPerformance widget reports slow timers it
    still gives you a good idea what was slow. And then you can use the
    chrome://tracing GUI to see the full story.
