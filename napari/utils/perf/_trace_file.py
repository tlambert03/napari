"""PerfTraceFile class to write the chrome://tracing file format (JSON)
"""

class PerfTraceFile:
    """Writes a chrome://tracing formatted JSON file.

    Chrome has a nice built-in performance tool called chrome://tracing. Chrome
    can record traces of web applications. But the format is well-documented and
    anyone can create the files and use the nice GUI. And other programs accept
    the format including:
    1) https://www.speedscope.app/ which does flamegraphs (Chrome doesn't).
    2) Qt Creator's performance tools.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : str
        Write the trace file to this path.

    Attributes
    ----------
    zero_ns : int
        perf_counter_ns() time when we started the trace.
    pid : int
        Process ID.
    outf : file handle
        JSON file we are writing to.

    Notes
    -----
    There are two chrome://tracing formats:
    1) JSON Array Format
    2) JSON Object Format

    We are using the JSON Array Format right now, the file can be cut off at
    anytime. The other format allows for more options if we need them but must
    be closed properly.

    See the "trace_event format" Google Doc for details:
    https://chromium.googlesource.com/catapult/+/HEAD/tracing/README.md
