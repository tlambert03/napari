"""Modified _hookexec caller.

When using a pluggy PluginManager, when you actually call a hook using their
syntax ``plugin_manager.hook.hook_spec_name(**kwargs)`` it goes through a
relatively complicated chain of methods and aliases before ultimately landing
on the basic function that loops through plugins: ``pluggy.callers._multicall``

This module is here as a patch because:

1. pluggy doesn't indicate WHICH hook implementation returned the result(s)...
   making it hard to provide useful tracebacks and feedback if one of them
   errors.

2. pluggy.callers._multicall does not wrap the actual call to hook
   implementations (``res = hook_impl.function(*args)``) in a try/except,
   meaning that if *any* of the implementations throw an error, the whole hook
   chain fails.

Example
-------
Calling hooks the normal way:
>>> result = plugin_manager.hook.my_hook(arg=arg)

is identical to calling them with execute_hook as follows:
>>> result = execute_hook(plugin_manager.hook.my_hook, arg=arg)

If you want to know which implementation is responsible for each result, use:

>>> # NOTE: this assumes plugin_manager.hook.my_hook has firstresult = True
>>> # otherwise a list would be returned.
>>> (result, imp) = execute_hook(
...                     plugin_manager.hook.my_hook,
...                     arg=arg,
...                     return_impl=True,
...                 )

NOTE: A version code here was submitted to pluggy as PR #253:
https://github.com/pytest-dev/pluggy/pull/253
We may want to consider removing this code if that merges, but we may also just
wish to maintain our internal hook looping logic.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hook_impls : list
        A sequence of hook implementation (HookImpl) objects
    caller_kwargs : dict
        Keyword:value pairs to pass to each ``hook_impl.function``.  Every
        key in the dict must be present in the ``argnames`` property for each
        ``hook_impl`` in ``hook_impls``.
    return_impl : bool, optional
        If ``True``, results are returned as a 2-tuple of ``(result,
        hook_impl)`` where ``hook_impl`` is the implementation responsible for
        returning the result.
    firstresult : bool, optional
        If ``True``, return the first non-null result found, otherwise, return
        a list of results from all hook implementations, by default False

    Returns
    -------
    Any or Tuple[Any, HookImpl] or List[Any] or List[Tuple[Any, HookImpl]]
        The result(s) retrieved from the hook implementations.
        If ``firstresult` is ``True``, then this function will return the first
        non-None result found when looping through ``hook_impls``.  Otherwise,
        a list of results will be returned.
        If ``return_impl`` is True, then results will be returned as a 2-tuple
        of ``(result, hook_impl)``, where ``hook_impl`` is the implementation
        responsible for returning the result.

    Raises
    ------
    HookCallError
        If one or more of the keys in ``caller_kwargs`` is not present in one
        of the ``hook_impl.argnames``.

    The difference is that this function offers the ability to skip certain

    the option of returning the HookImpl responsible for the result along with
    the result itself.

    ----------
    hook : _HookCaller
        An instance of a pluggy._HookCaller.
    skip_impls : Optional[Sequence[HookImpl]], optional
        Hook implementations to skip when looping, by default None

    kwargs : dict
        key/value pairs that will be passed to each hook implementation. These
