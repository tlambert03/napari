"""
All napari hook specifications for pluggable functionality are defined here.

A *hook specification* is a function signature (with documentation) that
declares an API that plugin developers must adhere to when providing hook
implementations.  *Hook implementations* provided by plugins (and internally by
napari) will then be invoked in various places throughout the code base.

When implementing a hook specification, pay particular attention to the number
and types of the arguments in the specification signature, as well as the
expected return type.

To allow for hook specifications to evolve over the lifetime of napari,
hook implementations may accept *fewer* arguments than defined in the
specification. (This allows for extending existing hook arguments without
breaking existing implementations). However, implementations must not require
*more* arguments than defined in the spec.

For more general background on the plugin hook calling mechanism, see the
`napari-plugin-manager documentation
<https://napari-plugin-engine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

.. NOTE::
    Hook specifications are a feature borrowed from `pluggy
    <https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#specs>`_. In the `pluggy
    documentation <https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, hook
    specification marker instances are named ``hookspec`` by convention, and
    hook implementation marker instances are named ``hookimpl``.  The
    convention in napari is to name them more explicitly:
    ``napari_hook_specification`` and ``napari_hook_implementation``,
    respectively.
"""

# These hook specifications also serve as the API reference for plugin
# developers, so comprehensive documentation with complete type annotations is
# imperative!

@napari_hook_specification(firstresult=True)
def napari_get_reader(path: Union[str, List[str]]) -> Optional[ReaderFunction]:
    """Return a function capable of loading ``path`` into napari, or ``None``.

    This is the primary "**reader plugin**" function.  It accepts a path or
    list of paths, and returns a list of data to be added to the ``Viewer``.

    The main place this hook is used is in :func:`Viewer.open()
    <napari.components.add_layers_mixin.AddLayersMixin.open>`, via the
    :func:`~napari.plugins.io.read_data_with_plugins` function.

    It will also be called on ``File -> Open...`` or when a user drops a file
    or folder onto the viewer. This function must execute **quickly**, and
    should return ``None`` if the filepath is of an unrecognized format for
    this reader plugin.  If ``path`` is determined to be recognized format,
    this function should return a *new* function that accepts the same filepath
    (or list of paths), and returns a list of ``LayerData`` tuples, where each
    tuple is a 1-, 2-, or 3-tuple of ``(data,)``, ``(data, meta)``, or ``(data,
    meta, layer_type)``.

    ``napari`` will then use each tuple in the returned list to generate a new
    layer in the viewer using the :func:`Viewer._add_layer_from_data()
    <napari.components.add_layers_mixin.AddLayersMixin._add_layer_from_data>`
    method.  The first, (optional) second, and (optional) third items in each
    tuple in the returned layer_data list, therefore correspond to the
    ``data``, ``meta``, and ``layer_type`` arguments of the
    :func:`Viewer._add_layer_from_data()
    <napari.components.add_layers_mixin.AddLayersMixin._add_layer_from_data>`
    method, respectively.

    .. important::

       ``path`` may be either a ``str`` or a ``list`` of ``str``.  If a
       ``list``, then each path in the list can be assumed to be one part of a
       larger multi-dimensional stack (for instance: a list of 2D image files
       that should be stacked along a third axis). Implementations should do
       their own checking for ``list`` or ``str``, and handle each case as
       desired.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : str or list of str
        Path to file, directory, or resource (like a URL), or a list of paths.

    Returns
    -------
    Callable or None
        A function that accepts the path, and returns a list of ``layer_data``,
        where ``layer_data`` is one of ``(data,)``, ``(data, meta)``, or
        ``(data, meta, layer_type)``.
        If unable to read the path, must return ``None`` (not ``False``!).
    """


@napari_hook_specification(firstresult=True)
def napari_get_writer(
    path: str, layer_types: List[str]
) -> Optional[WriterFunction]:
    """Return function capable of writing napari layer data to ``path``.

    This function will be called whenever the user attempts to save multiple
    layers (e.g. via ``File -> Save Layers``, or
    :func:`~napari.plugins.io.save_layers`).
    This function must execute **quickly**, and should return ``None`` if
    ``path`` has an unrecognized extension for the reader plugin or the list of
    layer types are incompatible with what the plugin can write. If ``path`` is
    a recognized format, this function should return a *function* that accepts
    the same ``path``, and a list of tuples containing the data for each layer
    being saved in the form of ``(Layer.data, Layer._get_state(),
    Layer._type_string)``. The writer function should return a list of strings
    (the actual filepath(s) that were written).

    .. important::

        It is up to plugins to inspect and obey any extension in ``path``
        (and return ``None`` if it is an unsupported extension).

    An example function signature for a ``WriterFunction`` that might be
    returned by this hook specification is as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

        def writer_function(
            path: str, layer_data: List[Tuple[Any, Dict, str]]
        ) -> List[str]:
            ...

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : str
        Path to file, directory, or resource (like a URL).  Any extensions in
        the path should be examined and obeyed.  (i.e. if the plugin is
        incapable of returning a requested extension, it should return
        ``None``).
    layer_types : list of str
        List of layer types (e.g. "image", "labels") that will be provided to
        the writer function.

    Returns
    -------
    Callable or None
        A function that accepts the path, a list of layer_data (where
        layer_data is ``(data, meta, layer_type)``). If unable to write to the
        path or write the layer_data, must return ``None`` (not ``False``).
