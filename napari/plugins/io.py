    This function returns as soon as the path has been read successfully,
    while catching any plugin exceptions, storing them for later retrievial,
    providing useful error messages, and relooping until either layer data is
    returned, or no readers are found.

    Exceptions will be caught and stored as PluginErrors

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : str
        The path (file, directory, url) to open
    plugin_manager : pluggy.PluginManager, optional
        Instance of a pluggy PluginManager.  by default the main napari

    Returns
    -------
    LayerData or None
        LayerData that can be *passed to _add_layer_from_data.  If no reader
        plugins are (or they all error), returns None
