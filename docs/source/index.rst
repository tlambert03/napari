napari
======

**napari** is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python.
It's designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional
images. It's built on top of `Qt <https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/>`_ (for the GUI),
`VisPy <http://vispy.org/>`_ (for performant GPU-based rendering), and the
scientific Python stack (`numpy <https://numpy.org/>`_,
`scipy <https://www.scipy.org/>`_).
